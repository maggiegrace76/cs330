When I design software, I start by breaking the big idea into smaller parts. I plan what I need to do before I start building anything. For this project, I learned new design skills like how to match 3D shapes to real-world objects and how to set up textures and lighting to make a scene look better. I followed a simple design process: first picking the objects, then building them with basic shapes, and finally adding textures and lights.

The way I planned everything before building really helped, and I think it will make future projects easier too. It saves time and helps everything fit together better.

When I develop programs, I like to work on small pieces first and test them before moving on. While making my 3D scene, I learned some new strategies like testing camera controls and lights early to catch problems sooner. I used a lot of iteration, which means I kept testing and fixing things as I went. I moved objects around, changed textures, and adjusted lighting many times until it looked right.

Over the milestones, my way of developing code got better. At first, I only focused on getting shapes into the scene. Later, I started paying more attention to how everything looked and worked together. This helped me finish the project with a better final scene.

Computer science will help me reach my goals because it teaches me how to solve problems and build things step-by-step. Learning computational graphics and visualizations gave me new skills like working in 3D spaces, setting up lighting, textures, and camera controls. These skills will help me in future classes that use OpenGL, Unity, or Unreal Engine.

In a professional setting, these skills can help me in jobs like making data visualizations, designing apps, or even working on games. Knowing how to build and control 3D spaces makes me ready for more advanced projects in the future.
